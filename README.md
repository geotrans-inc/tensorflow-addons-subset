# tensorflow-addons-subset

This is a subset of [tensorflow-addons](https://github.com/tensorflow/addons/tree/master) and only ports the functions used in repositories owned by Geotrans.
Since tensorflow-addons is no longer being developed, we will maintain only the necessary features here to support future Tensorflow updates.
